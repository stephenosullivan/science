        The apptools project includes a set of packages that Enthought has found
        useful in creating a number of applications.  They implement functionality
        that is commonly needed by many applications
        
        - **apptools.appscripting**: Framework for scripting applications.
        - **apptools.help**: Provides a plugin for displaying documents and examples
          and running demos in Envisage Workbench applications.
        - **apptools.io**: Provides an abstraction for files and folders in a file
          system.
        - **apptools.logger**: Convenience functions for creating logging handlers
        - **apptools.naming**: Manages naming contexts, supporting non-string data
          types and scoped preferences
        - **apptools.permissions**: Supports limiting access to parts of an
          application unless the user is appropriately authorised (not full-blown
          security).
        - **apptools.persistence**: Supports pickling the state of a Python object
          to a dictionary, which can then be flexibly applied in restoring the state of
          the object.
        - **apptools.preferences**: Manages application preferences.
        - **pyface.resource**: Manages application resources such as images and
          sounds.
        - **apptools.scripting**: A framework for automatic recording of Python
          scripts.
        - **apptools.sweet_pickle**: Handles class-level versioning, to support
          loading of saved data that exist over several generations of internal class
          structures.
        - **apptools.template**: Supports creating templatizable object hierarchies.
        - **apptools.type_manager**: Manages type extensions, including factories
          to generate adapters, and hooks for methods and functions.
        - **apptools.undo**: Supports undoing and scripting application commands.
